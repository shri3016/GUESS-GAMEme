# About The Project
Implemented a React Native app that allows users to play a number guessing game. The app includes features such as generating a random number to guess, keeping track of the user's input, and providing hints based on the app's guesses for an interactive and engaging gaming experience. The game state, including the randomly generated number, user's input, and number of rounds taken, is managed using state management techniques.

# Technologies Used
* React Native: A popular JavaScript framework for building mobile applications.
* Native components: UI components that are built using native elements of the        platform, providing a native-like look and feel.
* Expo Go: A toolchain and platform for developing, building, and deploying React Native applications.

# Features
* React Native app for playing a number guessing game.
* Utilization of state management techniques to keep track of game state, including randomly generated number, user's input, and number of rounds taken.
* Logic for providing hints to the user based on the app's guesses, indicating        whether the guess is greater or less than the user's number.
* Intuitive and user-friendly UI using React Native components, including text input   and button components, for smooth user interactions and gameplay.
